# üóÑÔ∏è Database Design ‚Äî BEESOCIAL 
## üìã Overview

BEESOCIAL uses MongoDB (document DB). This document is a corrected and consolidated design based on the actual Mongoose models in the project. It lists main collections, important fields, indexes, and common query patterns. Avoid changing semantics ‚Äî only clarifications, consistency fixes and small improvements were applied.

## üèóÔ∏è Collections (summary)

Core collections:

-   users
-   profiles
-   posts
-   comments
-   likeposts
-   commentlikes
-   shareposts

Auxiliary collections (examples from codebase):

-   categories, categoryposts
-   hashtags, hashtagposts, trendingHashtags, trendingPosts
-   notifications
-   follow, feed
-   reports
-   businessRequest, businessPost, postTransaction, unitPrice, advertisementPlan
-   issueTypes, userPreferences

---

## üìä Collection details (aligned with models)

### 1. users

Purpose: authentication and account metadata.

Example fields (reflects backend/models/userModel.js):

```javascript
{
  _id,
  email: String (unique, required, lowercase),
  phonenumber: String,
  role: String enum ["user","business","admin"],
  isActived: Boolean,
  password: String (hashed, select:false),
  passwordConfirm: (validation only),
  passwordChangedAt: Date,
  preferences: [ObjectId ref Category],
  refreshToken: String,
  verifyToken: String,
  verify: Boolean,
  approved: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

Important:

-   Virtual: profile (one-to-one) via Profile.user
-   Indexes: email (unique), role, isActived
-   Pre-save: bcrypt hashing, remove passwordConfirm
-   Pre-find: populate profile, exclude sensitive tokens (models sometimes use active vs isActived ‚Äî queries use active check in some pre-hooks; keep consistent to isActived)

---

### 2. profiles

Purpose: public profile info.

Fields (reflects backend/models/profileModel.js):

```javascript
{
  firstname, lastname, slug (unique),
  gender (Boolean),
  avatar, background, address, bio, birthday,
  user: ObjectId ref User (unique index)
}
```

Rules:

-   firstname/lastname: regex /^[a-zA-Z0-9_\p{L}]+$/u
-   slug: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/ , unique
-   Index: { user: 1 } unique

---

### 3. posts

Purpose: user posts; supports sharing via parent.

Fields (reflects backend/models/postModel.js):

```javascript
{
  _id,
  content: String (trimmed, max ~8192),
  images: [String] (<=4),
  imageVideo: String,
  categories: [ObjectId ref Category],
  user: ObjectId ref User (required),
  parent: ObjectId ref Post (for shares),
  numLikes, numComments, numShares,
  createdAt,
  isActived: Boolean
}
```

Important:

-   Pre-find: populate user -> profile and categories, populate parent (shared post)
-   Post-save: update parent's numShares; extract hashtags and create Hashtag + HashtagPost entries
-   Pre findOneAndUpdate: keep hashtag relations in sync (delete removed, add new)

Indexes:

-   { user: 1 }, { createdAt: -1 }, { isActived: 1 }, { parent: 1 }

---

### 4. comments

Purpose: threaded comments with unlimited nesting.

Fields (reflects backend/models/commentModel.js):

```javascript
{
  _id,
  content: String (1-1000, required),
  user: ObjectId ref User,
  post: ObjectId ref Post,
  parent: ObjectId ref Comment (nullable),
  numLikes: Number,
  numReplies: Number,
  createdAt
}
```

Behavior:

-   post-save: update Post.numComments and parent.numReplies when applicable
-   pre/post findOneAndDelete: store deleted doc then recalc counts
-   pre-find: populate user -> profile

Indexes:

-   { post: 1 }, { parent: 1 }, { user: 1 }

---

### 5. likeposts

Purpose: track likes on posts.

Fields:

```javascript
{ user: ObjectId ref User, post: ObjectId ref Post, createdAt }
```

Constraints:

-   Composite unique index { user:1, post:1 }

Behavior:

-   post-save & post-delete: recalc Post.numLikes

Indexes:

-   { user:1, post:1 } unique, { post:1 }

---

### 6. commentlikes

Purpose: track likes on comments.

Fields:

```javascript
{ comment: ObjectId, user: ObjectId, createdAt }
```

Constraints:

-   Composite unique index { user:1, comment:1 }

Behavior:

-   post-save & post-delete: recalc Comment.numLikes

Indexes:

-   { user:1, comment:1 } unique, { comment:1 }

---

### 7. shareposts

Purpose: support analytics for shares (model: SharePost).

Fields:

```javascript
{ sharer: ObjectId ref User, post: ObjectId ref Post, createdAt }
```

Behavior:

-   Creating a shared Post (parent reference) and a SharePost document; Post.setNumShares updates counts.

Indexes:

-   { post:1 }, { sharer:1 }

---

## üîó Other models (quick notes)

-   notifications: recipient (User), type enum, actors array (strings), contentId, subContentId, read flag. Post-save pushes to Pusher.
-   feed: user + post + type (following/suggested/advertisement), seen flag, dateToBeSeen
-   follow: follower/following pairs
-   report: reporter, post, reason, status, processingDate
-   hashtags & hashtagposts: keep many-to-many relation between posts and hashtags; index by hashtag and createdAt
-   trendingHashtag / trendingPost: aggregated data for trends (pre-find population implemented)
-   business models (BusinessRequest, BusinessPost, PostTransaction, UnitPrice, AdvertisementPlan): used for promoted posts & billing. BusinessPost is a discriminator of Post.

---

## üîç Indexing strategy (recommendations)

Create indexes used by models and queries:

-   users: { email:1 } unique, { role:1 }, { isActived:1 }
-   profiles: { user:1 } unique, { slug:1 } unique
-   posts: { user:1 }, { createdAt: -1 }, { isActived:1 }, { parent:1 }
-   comments: { post:1 }, { parent:1 }, { user:1 }
-   likeposts: { user:1, post:1 } unique, { post:1 }
-   commentlikes: { user:1, comment:1 } unique, { comment:1 }
-   feed: { user:1 }
-   hashtagpost: { hashtag:-1 }, { createdAt:-1 }
-   shareposts: { post:1 }, { sharer:1 }

---

## ‚úÖ Common query patterns (aligned with code)

-   Feed timeline:
    Post.find({ isActived: true }).populate("user", ...).populate("parent").sort({ createdAt: -1 }).limit(20)

-   Post with threaded comments:
    fetch root comments (parent:null) then fetch replies by parent in rootCommentIds

-   Profile page:
    Profile.findOne({ slug }).populate("user"); Post.find({ user: profile.user.\_id, isActived: true }).sort({ createdAt: -1 });

-   Check like status:
    LikePost.exists({ user: userId, post: postId })

-   Share flow:
    create Post with parent set, create SharePost, call Post.setNumShares(originalPostId)

---

## üöÄ Optimizations & best practices

-   Denormalize counters (numLikes, numComments, numReplies, numShares) and maintain via model hooks (already implemented).
-   Soft-delete pattern: use isActived (ensure hooks and queries consistently use isActived, not active).
-   Use virtual population (User ‚Üî Profile) to avoid extra collections loads.
-   Avoid N+1 on likes: consider bulk lookups (e.g., fetch LikePost documents for a page of posts and map).
-   Cache hot data (popular posts, frequently requested profiles) in Redis.
-   Archive old posts (>1 year) if required.

---

## üîí Security & integrity

-   Keep password hashing (bcrypt) and passwordChangedAt semantics.
-   Use proper validators as implemented in schemas.
-   Ensure tokens (refreshToken, verifyToken) are not returned in API responses (models already select them out in pre-find).
-   Index uniqueness to enforce constraints (slug, email, composite likes).

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor fixes / recommendations applied

-   Standardized field names: prefer isActived (used in many models). Search codebase for any remaining uses of "active" and align.
-   Fixed regex Unicode flags in profile validation (u flag used).
-   Clarified hashtag extract behavior in Post model and ensured HashtagPost operations use correct post ids.
-   Noted places where pre/post hooks call next() multiple times ‚Äî inspect PostSchema.post("save") (there was an extra next()).
